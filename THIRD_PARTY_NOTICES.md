# Third-party notices

Boarding Pass's own code is © 2026 Mac under the MIT licence (see `LICENSE`). It is built on the maps, data and software below, which belong to their makers and are used under their own licences. The same credits are shown in the game under **Credits and licences** (on the home screen, and in the Map layers menu).

Boarding Pass is a game. It is not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by any airline, aircraft maker or airport. Airline, aircraft and airport names are used only to identify them and belong to their owners. Schedules, passengers, weather and flight paths are simulated: not for navigation or real flight planning.

## Maps (loaded over the internet while you play)

- **CARTO basemaps** (Dark Matter and Positron styles, vector tiles): © CARTO, https://carto.com/attributions. Used under the CARTO basemap terms (free for non-commercial use, with attribution): https://carto.com/legal/basemap-terms/
- **Map data:** © OpenStreetMap contributors, under the Open Database Licence (ODbL), https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
- **Satellite imagery:** EOxCloudless https://cloudless.eox.at by EOX IT Services GmbH (Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data 2024), under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), https://cloudless.eox.at/license-non-commercial. Used for non-commercial purposes only.

The map credits are shown on the map itself (the (i) in the corner).

## Data (included in `public/data`)

- **OurAirports** (`airports.csv`, `runways.csv`, `navaids.csv`): https://ourairports.com/data/, released into the public domain.
- **airline-route-data** by Jonty Wareing (`network.json`, routes and airlines): https://github.com/Jonty/airline-route-data, the routes airlines publish, collected weekly. Route demand and the other airlines' schedules in the game are worked out from these routes.
- **GeoNames** (`network.json`, population around each airport): https://www.geonames.org, under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence (CC BY 4.0), https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. The game adds up the population of the towns and cities around each airport; the numbers are changed from the original (summed and shared between nearby airports).
- **OpenStreetMap** (`cargo-aprons.json`, cargo aprons and cargo stands at airports): © OpenStreetMap contributors, under the Open Database Licence (ODbL), https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright. Built by `tools/build-cargo-aprons.mjs` from the Overpass API; the outlines are simplified (at most 48 points each). The file is a derived database under the ODbL and is shared under the same licence.

`network.json` is made from these by `tools/build-network.mjs`.

## Typefaces (included in the game since v2.35)

**Barlow** and **Barlow Condensed** by Jeremy Tribby, bundled through the Fontsource packages `@fontsource/barlow` and `@fontsource/barlow-condensed`.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
